# node-js-crash-course

I'm a 12 years experienced Senior Staff software engineer, but my most recent job has got me mostly doing managerial/lead level technical tasks, not many development task.

I plan to perform a crash course on Node.js and React.js within the next 7 days, investing heavy-hour daily. I also need to sharpen my rusty DS/Algo knowledge. More things to cover: Web security methods and use cases, Design Patterns, AWS Basics.

No mercy, I will study for one week, 4-hours daily, as much as humanly possible.
